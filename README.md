# Kot
 Kot is a basic toolkit for getting started with computerised adaptive testing (CAT) in Ruby.

It includes:
  - a module to calculate item response theory (IRT) statistics for dichotomous items with 1-4PL characteristic curves (ICCs), 
  - a Hill Climbing ability (theta) estimator, 
  - a Randomesque selector and 
  - a Test class to make tying all this together easier.

douglasrizzo's [catsim](https://github.com/douglasrizzo/catsim) and its excellent documentation, 
without which I wouldn't have been able to cobble this together.
